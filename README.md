# cesium-bower
### A [bower](http://bower.io) package for [Cesiumjs](http://cesiumjs.org/)

Analytical Graphics, Inc. does not offer a bower package for the 3d mapping library Cesium.

This project is simply a wrapper for the [Cesiumjs repository](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/) allowing Cesium to be used with bower. 

This package only includes __unaltered__ minified code and assets.  

Need the unminified code? We have that too, read [here](https://github.com/ZacBrownBand/cesium-bower/wiki/Getting-unminified-Cesium-code).

### Installation

$ bower install cesium-bower --save
```
