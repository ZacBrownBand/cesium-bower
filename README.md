# cesium-bower
### A [bower](http://bower.io) package for [Cesiumjs](http://cesiumjs.org/)

Analytical Graphics, Inc. does not offer a bower package for the 3d mapping library Cesium.

This project is simply a wrapper for the [Cesiumjs repository](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/) allowing Cesium to be used with bower.  
To use this Cesium bower package just use `bower install cesium-bower`.  

This package will only include the minified code and assets. __It does not contain any edits__.
